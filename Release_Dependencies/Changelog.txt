Total changelog: (1.1.9b5)
- Complete new VR keyboard system added by Nordskog. Great work!
- Water performance workaround - Transparent objects won't render in other transparent objects, but it's worth it for the performance improvement.
- Upgraded to a newer version of bepinex. This makes the installation much simpler, but a game file wipe might be needed. Be sure to look at the new install instructions!

Total changelog: (1.1.9b2)

Bugfixes:
- (R6 Specific) - Fix bioscanner crashing the game

Total changelog: (1.1.9b1)

Ported to R6! The game is very performance hungry, even moreso this update, so I recommend lowering your in-game settings greatly!
Turn off SSAO, bloom, subsurface scattering, depth of field, motion blur etc
Lower fog resolution, fog diffusion quality

Bugfixes:
- Fix headlight rendering for pimax, odd shadow rendering for all HMDs
- Opening audio logs in terminals with VR keyboard (casing issue)
- Fix VR render resolution config not applying at the start
- (R6 Specific) - Gun flashlight rendering fixed
- (R6 Specific) - Terminal exit influencing camera
- (R6 Specific) - Weapon lagging behind player movement
- (R6 Specific) - Gun flashlight rendering fixed
- (R6 Specific) - Decal rendering
- (R6 Specific) - Fixed melee weapon hit delay
- (R6 Specific) - Laserpointer color always white due to new color space
- (R6 Specific) - Fog/Light resolution changes in VR

Tweaks:
- Weapon ammo hologram BG is now a little less bright
- (R6 Specific) - Weapon icon sizes reduced to fit into radial menu
- Tweaked weapon zeroing to be more accurate at short distances
- All melee weapon hitboxes

Additions:
- All new melee weapons work in VR
- (By Devs!) All gun sights are now rendered correctly in VR

Removals:
- Removed light/fog resolution config tweak, it gave more artifact and very little performance. Devs added more fog resolution options so use those instead!
- Removed bloom from VR options, it's now in the base game, tweakable under graphics

Known issues:
- R6 is very VRAM hungry! If your texture or render resolution settings are too high and you're using too much VRAM your game will be very unstable!
  changing resolution in-game or even playing some maps might cause crashes! 
- Vignette effect is broken at the moment
