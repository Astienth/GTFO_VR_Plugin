Total changelog (1.3.0):

!!! IMPORTANT !!! 

- Upgraded mod to BepInEx 670 (now compatible with other GTFO mods!) 
... This does mean you will need to upgrade. A new BepInEx version has been linked in the readme. The mod will NOT work without upgrading! 
... Other mods might overwrite your BepInEx version. This will break things!

The BepInEx version shipped with other mods will NOT work at this time!

Known issues:
- GTFO is very VRAM hungry! If your texture or render resolution settings are too high and you're using too much VRAM your game will be very unstable!
  Changing resolution in-game or even playing some maps might cause crashes depending on your resolution and/or texture resolution settings!
  
- For Quest headsets: Link/airlink are very crash-prone. Playing using VD is recommended.

- VR Performance kit causes darkened image output. The fixed version provided in the main release only seems to work on the Valve Index.
