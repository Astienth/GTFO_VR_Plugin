Total changelog (1.3.2b7):

Many thanks to @Alchemist and @Roughy!

- Made shockwave integration disabled by default, as it has been known to cause issues. If you run into any, let us know!
- Improved efficiency of rendering by improving the hidden area mesh and skipping some work that is the same for both eyes.
- Made hidden area mesh toggleable, as it might cause artifacting on some setups (edges of screen not rendering)
- Removed an outdated config option (skip damage feedback)

Total changelog (1.3.1b3):

- Added FPS limit in menu. This is a possible fix for the menu stutter issue. Let us know if it still happens!

- Fixed unupdated library causing issues

Total changelog (1.3.0):

!!! IMPORTANT !!! 

- Upgraded mod to BepInEx 670 (now compatible with other GTFO mods!) 
... This does mean you will need to upgrade. A new BepInEx version has been linked in the readme. The mod will NOT work without upgrading! 
... Other mods might overwrite your BepInEx version. This will break things!

- Fix laser disappearing in thermal sights when starting multiple missions without restarting

The BepInEx version shipped with other mods will NOT work at this time! 


Total changelog: (1.2.2):
- Added Shockwave suit integration
- Fixed the following weapon sights:
* Drekker Pres MOD 556 Rifle
* Techman Arbalist machine gun
* Techman Klust 6 Burst Cannon

Total changelog: (1.2.1):
- Added ProtubeVR Haptics support
- Tweaked every weapon in the game to have its own haptics 'identity'

Known issues:
- GTFO is very VRAM hungry! If your texture or render resolution settings are too high and you're using too much VRAM your game will be very unstable!
  Changing resolution in-game or even playing some maps might cause crashes depending on your resolution and/or texture resolution settings!
  
- For Quest headsets: Link/airlink are very crash-prone. Playing using VD is recommended.

- VR Performance kit causes darkened image output. The fixed version provided in the main release only seems to work on the Valve Index.
